# Toolchain — Real Path That Exists Today

> Document before compiling. No claim that `C → Malbolge` works until each edge is demonstrated.

## Pinned Versions

See `TOOLCHAIN_LOCK.json` for exact commits — HEAD today (2026-09-01):

- `shinh/elvm` `020d1d8c` — contains `target/hell` (HeLL backend)
- `shinh/8cc` `2fd8c549` (branch `eir`) — `8cc` that emits EIR
- `ozkl/doomgeneric` `dcb7a8db` — 5-function Doom port
- `esoteric-programmer/LMFAO` `c62bbe32` — HeLL assembler
- `lutter.cc/Unshackled.c` + `Unshackled.hs` — Unshackled VMs

## Canonical Pipeline

```
hello.c  →  8cc -S -o hello.eir hello.c          # C → EIR (Harvard, 6 regs, 24-bit)
hello.eir → elvm target/hell → hello.hell        # EIR → HeLL
hello.hell → LMFAO → hello.mu                    # HeLL → Malbolge Unshackled
hello.mu → Unshackled.c → output                 # run
```

Or via ELVM make shortcut (once toolchain built):

```bash
HELL=1 make hell           # ELVM warns: extremely slow, adjust tools/runhell.sh
# produces out/*.eir.hell and out/*.eir.mu
```

## What ELVM Docs Actually Say

- HeLL is *"assembly language for Malbolge and Malbolge Unshackled. Use LMFAO to build."*
- *"This backend won't be tested by default because Malbolge Unshackled is extremely slow. Use HELL=1 make hell. Note you may need to adjust tools/runhell.sh."*
- *"This backend does not support all 8-bit characters on I/O, because I/O uses Unicode codepoints instead of single bytes. [...] You should limit I/O to ASCII."*
- `"The backend reverts/converts newlines [...] but cannot compensate [...] Limit to ASCII."*

## 8cc / EIR Facts

- EIR = `mov, add, sub, load, store, setcc, jcc, putc, getc, exit` + pseudo `.text/.data/.long/.string`
- 6 regs: A,B,C,D,SP,BP. No bit ops, no float. `sizeof(char)==sizeof(int)==sizeof(void* )==1`. Most backends 24-bit words.
- `mul/div/mod` via `__builtin_*`.

## Doomgeneric Facts

- 5 required funcs: `DG_Init, DG_DrawFrame, DG_SleepMs, DG_GetTicksMs, DG_GetKey` (+ optional `DG_SetWindowTitle`)
- Main loop: `doomgeneric_Create(argc,argv); while(1) doomgeneric_Tick();`
- `DG_ScreenBuffer` is the framebuffer (320×200, 8-bit paletted → expanded to 32-bit in ports).
- License GPL-2.0.

## Known Gaps — Not Invented

- `C → HeLL` has not been demonstrated on this host until `M0` runs. If it fails, document where: `C→EIR` / `EIR→HeLL` / `LMFAO assemble` / `Unshackled run` / I/O.
- LMFAO build requires Haskell or C toolchain depending on version — verify on this host.
- Unshackled rotation width is variable (≥10, grows when `j` widens `D`). Programs must probe it — the ELVM-generated prologue handles this, but we must measure artifact size and runtime.
- Classic Malbolge 59049 memory is NOT used for Doom full — that's TARGET_B `NOT_DEMONSTRATED`.

## Local Classic Synthesis

MALDOOM vendors the minimum Classic search substrate at
`vendor/classic_synthesis/`; it does not need an Autobolge or MALPAD clone at
runtime. Source commits, licenses, SHA256 values and credit are frozen in
`vendor/classic_synthesis/PROVENANCE.md` and `SHA256SUMS.txt`.

```powershell
cd vendor/classic_synthesis
zig build-exe branch_search.zig -O Debug "-femit-bin=branch_search.exe"
.\branch_search.exe 2 20 A A B B
# EXPECT: ub input1_steps=3 input2_steps=3; BRANCH total=64 hits=1
```

This searcher is tooling only. It never participates in Doom gameplay or in
the runtime host. The included MALPAD truth-machine is a verified non-echo
branch/halt seed; its source license was absent at the recorded source commit,
so its provenance must accompany every redistribution.

## Verification on This Host (to fill after fetch)

```bash
# after fetch
ls vendor/elvm/target/hell/
ls vendor/8cc/           # eir branch
./vendor/Unshackled vendor/build/M0_A_CONST.mu < /dev/null
```

Record exact output, SHA-256, wall time in `evidence/`.
